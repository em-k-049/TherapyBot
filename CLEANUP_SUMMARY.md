# TherapyBot Cleanup Summary

## âœ… Test Fix Applied
- **Fixed failing test in `frontend/tests/chat.spec.js` line 93**
- Changed from exact text match to regex pattern: `/I understand you need help/i`
- This allows flexible matching regardless of timestamps or minor variations

## âœ… Project Structure Cleaned

### New Organized Structure:
```
/backend/          - FastAPI backend (unchanged)
/frontend/         - React frontend (unchanged)
/docs/            - All documentation files
/tests/           - All root-level test files
/reports/         - Test results and reports
/scripts/         - Utility scripts (unchanged)
/infra/           - Infrastructure configs (unchanged)
/monitoring/      - Monitoring configs (unchanged)
/nginx/           - Nginx configs (unchanged)
/secrets/         - Secrets (unchanged)
```

### Files Moved:
- **To /docs/**: 10 documentation files (AI guides, testing docs, etc.)
- **To /tests/**: 10 test files + run_tests.py
- **To /reports/**: Test results from frontend and backend

### Files Deleted:
- `voice_test.html`
- `test_frontend_endpoints.html`
- `test_curl_commands.md`
- `project_synopsis.txt`
- Duplicate directories and typo files

### Root Directory Now Contains Only:
- Essential config files (docker-compose.yml, .env, etc.)
- README.md
- Makefile
- quick_test.py
- Start scripts

## ðŸ§ª Next Steps:
1. Run `python quick_test.py` to verify tests pass
2. Update any scripts that reference moved files
3. Consider updating README.md with new structure
